# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Classification

# Introduction
# Objective
The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes
based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.

# Description of the dataset
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.  Several constraints were placed
on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. The dataset consist of 769 records and 11 features. The dataset is stored in CSV file. it consist of several independent variables (several medical predictor variables) and only one target dependent variable (Outcome). The features are:
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
